# JupyterDay Code of Conduct
## Procedures and Enforcement Guidelines

The goal of this document is to continually improve the community and create a
safe and welcoming space for all. Ignoring our guidance or requests for
compliance will have real consequences, such as being asked to leave the event,
to ensure attendees feel they are protected. When taking action on any report,
consider:

* The privacy and protection of the reporter are your first and foremost
  concern. 
* Try to understand context and intent to get the whole picture, but
  note that  lack of intent to harm is not an excuse, and still requires redress
  to the injured party. 
* For language-based issues, find out if the reported party is a native English
  speaker.  It is very easy for a non-native speaker to make an innocent mistake
  they aren't even aware of, by transliteration or misuse of English words they
  original language.  Non-native speakers will often feel already uncomfortable in
  an English-only environment; approach them with the intention of explaining what
  the problem is.  A change of behavior may still be required, but a clarification
  of the language issue is more likely to produce benefit than purely punitive
  action. Stronger measures can still be  taken if the person continues to engage
 
## Warnings

Event Managers/Lead Organizers can issue a verbal warning to a participant that
their behavior violates the conference's anti-harassment policy. Make clear to
the participant that if they ignore the warning their participation in the event
may not longer be welcome (in other words they may be expelled). 

Warnings should be reported to Ana Ruvalcaba via email ruv7.ana@gmail.com as
soon as practical. The report should include:
* Identifying information (name/affiliation) of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The behavior that was in violation
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your full name
* Other people involved in the incident

## Presentations

Presentations, audience comments, or similar events should not be stopped for
one-time gaffes or minor problems, although Event Managers/Lead Organizers
should speak to the presenter/audience member afterward. However, Event
Managers/Lead Organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly
stop any presentation/audience comment/event that repeatedly or seriously
violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this
presentation/comment is not appropriate and cannot be continued at the present
time" with no further explanation.

Coach the speakers so that they are aware that they do not have to tolerate or
respond to comments/questions which violates our code of conduct during their
presentation.

## Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what
they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making
specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. 

Ask for information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place)
but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report
lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing
actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff
member(s). 

If the reporter requests additional support, you may assist them by asking for
help from conference staff, a trusted person, contact a friend or contact local
law enforcement. Do not pressure the person submitting the report to take any
action if they do not wish to do so. Respect the reporter's privacy by not
sharing unnecessary details with other staff or conference participants,
especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or responsible
for resolving it.

## Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of the Lead Organizer/Event
Manager for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some
general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:
* A second offense resulting in an additional warning from Event Manager/Lead
  Organizer 
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* A single serious offense (e.g., physical violence or groping someone)
* A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)

Hotel/venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

## Public statements

As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about
the behavior of individual people during or after the conference.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when
necessary.
