# FEniCS Code of Conduct

We strive to make FEniCS an open and respectful community. This code
of conduct sets out the expected standards of behaviour for the FEniCS
community. It applies to participation in all FEniCS activities, which
includes online Forums and FEniCS Workshops.


## Respect

Engage politely and respectfully. There will be disagreements, but
this is no excuse for impolite, aggressive or threatening behaviour.
Personal attacks are not acceptable.


## Collaboration

Collaboration is an essential tenet of the FEniCS Project. Users and
Contributors should aim to interact, share ideas and communicate new
FEniCS directions. New developments
should be proposed and discussed on FEniCS mailing lists
and chat channels.


## Interaction

Inappropriate behaviour on FEniCS Forums or at FEniCS Workshops is
unacceptable. Participants who behave inappropriately may be asked to
leave the FEniCS Community by the Steering Council.


## Reporting

Individuals can report violations of this Code of Conduct to a member
of the Steering Council, who will investigate.
