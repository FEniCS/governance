# Main Governance Document

The official version of this document, along with a list of
individuals and institutions in the roles defined in the governance
section below, is contained in The Project Governance Repository at
<https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/governance>

## The Project

The FEniCS Project (The Project) is an open source software project
affiliated with the 501c3 NumFocus Foundation. The goal of The Project
is to develop open source software for scientific computing. The
Software developed by The Project is released under the LGPL (or
similar) open source license, developed openly and hosted in public
repositories under the
[FEniCS Bitbucket organization](https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/).
Examples of Project Software include DOLFIN, FEniCS Form Compiler
(FFC) and the Unified Form Language (UFL), etc.  The Services run by
the Project consist of public websites and web-services that are
hosted under the fenicsproject.org domain.

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called
Contributors. Contributors are individuals who have contributed code,
documentation, designs or other work to one or more Project
repositories.  Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can be
affiliated with any legal entity or none. Contributors participate in
the project by submitting, reviewing and discussing Pull Requests and
Issues and participating in open and public Project discussions on
Bitbucket, Google+, Slack channels and mailing lists. The foundation
of Project participation is openness and transparency.

Here is a list of the current Contributors to the DOLFIN, FFC and UFL
repositories:

- [https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfin/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfin/graphs/contributors)
- [https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfin/ffc/contributors](https://github.com/FEniCS/ffc/graphs/contributors)
- [https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfin/ufc/contributors](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl/graphs/contributors)

There are also many other Contributors listed in the logs of other repositories of
FEniCS projects.

The Project Community consists of all Contributors and Users of the
Project.  Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the
larger Project Community and we strive to keep the barrier between
Contributors and Users as low as possible.

The Project is formally affiliated with the 501c3 NumFOCUS Foundation
([http://numfocus.org](http://numfocus.org)), which serves as its
fiscal sponsor, may hold project trademarks and other intellectual
property, helps manage project donations and acts as a parent legal
entity. NumFOCUS is the only legal entity that has a formal
relationship with the project (see Institutional Partners section
below).


## Governance

This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.

The foundations of Project governance are:

- Openness & Transparency
- Active Contribution
- Institutional Neutrality

Traditionally, Project leadership was provided by a 
subset of Contributors, called Core Developers, whose
active and consistent contributions have been recognized by their
receiving “commit rights” to the Project GitHub repositories. In
general all Project decisions are made through consensus among the
Core Developers with input from the Community. 

While this approach has served us well, as the Project grows and faces
more legal and financial decisions and interacts with other
institutions, we see a need for a more formal governance model. Moving
forward The Project leadership will consist of a Steering
Council. We view this governance model as the formalization of what we
are already doing, rather than a change in direction.


### Steering Council

The Project will have a Steering Council that consists of Project
Contributors who have produced contributions that are substantial in
quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one year. The
overall role of the Council is to ensure, through working with and
taking input from the Community, the long-term well-being of the
project, both technically and as a community.

During the everyday project activities, council members participate in
all discussions, code review and other project activities as peers
with all other Contributors and the Community. In these everyday
activities, Council Members do not have any special power or privilege
through their membership on the Council. However, it is expected that
because of the quality and quantity of their contributions and their
expert knowledge of the Project Software and Services that Council
Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and in terms of
project direction, to potentially less experienced contributors.

The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain
situations.  In particular, the Council may:

- Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of
  the project.
- Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other
  organizations or individuals.
- Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and
  pull requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code
  review process and merging pull requests.
- Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and
  manage those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.
- Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce
  consensus on an issue in a reasonable time frame.


### Council membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member an individual
must be a Project Contributor who has produced contributions that are
substantial in quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one
year. Potential Council Members are nominated by existing Council
members and voted upon by the existing Council after asking if the
potential Member is interested and willing to serve in that
capacity. The Council will be initially formed from the set of
existing Core Developers who, as of mid 2016, have been significantly
active over the last year.

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at
candidates with a comprehensive view of their contributions. This will
include but is not limited to code, code review, infrastructure work,
mailing list and chat participation, community help/building,
education and outreach, design work, etc. We are deliberately not
setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like “100 commits in this
repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather
than the project’s overall well-being. We want to encourage a diverse
array of backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why
we explicitly do not define code as the sole metric on which Council
membership will be evaluated.

If a Council member becomes inactive in the project for a period of
one year, they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before
removal, the inactive Member will be approached by another Council member to see if they
plan on returning to active participation. If not they will be removed
immediately upon a Council vote. If they plan on returning to active
participation soon, they will be given a grace period of one year. If
they do not return to active participation within that time period they
will be removed by vote of the Council without further grace
period. All former Council members can be considered for membership
again at any time in the future, like any other Project Contributor.
Retired Council members will be listed on the project website,
acknowledging the period during which they were active in the Council.

The Council reserves the right to eject current Members 
if they are deemed to be actively harmful to the project’s
well-being, and attempts at communication and conflict resolution have
failed.


### Conflict of interest

It is expected that Council Members will be employed at a
wide range of companies, universities and non-profit
organizations. Because of this, it is possible that Members will have
conflict of interests. Such conflict of interests include, but are not
limited to:

- Financial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting
  work, outside of The Project that may influence their work on The
  Project.
- Access to proprietary information of their employer that could
  potentially leak into their work with the Project.

All members of the Council shall disclose to the rest of the Council
any conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of
interest in a particular issue may participate in Council discussions
on that issue, but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue.


### Private communications of the Council

Unless specifically required, all Council discussions and activities
will be public and done in collaboration and discussion with the
Project Contributors and Community. The Council will have a private
mailing list or chat channel that will be used sparingly and only when a specific
matter requires privacy. When private communications and decisions are
needed, the Council will do its best to summarize those to the
Community after eliding personal/private/sensitive information that
should not be posted to the public internet.


### Subcommittees

The Council can create subcommittees that provide leadership and
guidance for specific aspects of the project. Like the Council as a
whole, subcommittees should conduct their business in an open and
public manner unless privacy is specifically called for. Private
subcommittee communications should happen on the main private mailing
list or chat channel of the Council unless specifically called for.
All subcommittees report to Council.


### NumFOCUS Subcommittee

The Council will maintain one narrowly focused subcommittee to manage
its interactions with NumFOCUS.

- The NumFOCUS Subcommittee is comprised of 3 persons who manage
  project funding that comes through NumFOCUS. It is expected that
  these funds will be spent in a manner that is consistent with the
  non-profit mission of NumFOCUS and the direction of the Project as
  determined by the full Council.
- This Subcommittee shall NOT make decisions about the direction,
  scope or technical direction of the Project.
- This Subcommittee will have 5 members, 4 of whom will be current
  Council Members and 1 of whom will be external to the Steering
  Council. No more than 2 Subcommitee Members can report to one person
  through employment or contracting work (including the reportee,
  i.e. the reportee + 1 is the max). This avoids effective majorities
  resting on one person.


## Institutional Partners and Funding

The Steering Council is the primary leadership for the
project. No outside institution, individual or legal entity has the
ability to own, control, usurp or influence the project other than by
participating in the Project as Contributors and Council
Members. However, because institutions are the primary funding
mechanism for the project, it is important to formally acknowledge
institutional participation in the project. These are Institutional
Partners.

An Institutional Contributor is any individual Project Contributor who
contributes to the project as part of their official duties at an
Institutional Partner. Likewise, an Institutional Council Member is
any Project Steering Council Member who contributes to the project as
part of their official duties at an Institutional Partner.

With these definitions, an Institutional Partner is any recognized
legal entity in the United States or elsewhere that employs at least
one Institutional Contributor or Institutional Council
Member. Institutional Partners can be for-profit or non-profit
entities.

Institutions become eligible to become an Institutional Partner by
employing individuals who actively contribute to The Project as part
of their official duties. To state this another way, the only way for
an Institutional Partner to influence the project is by actively
contributing to the open development of the project, on equal terms
with any other member of the community of Contributors and Council
Members. Merely using FEniCS Software or Services in an
institutional context does not allow an entity to become an
Institutional Partner. Financial gifts do not enable an entity to
become an Institutional Partner. Once an institution becomes eligible
for Institutional Partnership, the Steering Council must nominate and
approve the Partnership.

If an existing Institutional Partner no longer has a contributing
employee, they will be given a one-year grace period for other
employees to begin contributing.

An Institutional Partner is free to pursue funding for their work on
The Project through any legal means. This could involve a non-profit
organization raising money from private foundations and donors or a
for-profit company building proprietary products and services that
leverage Project Software and Services. Funding acquired by
Institutional Partners to work on The Project is called Institutional
Funding. However, no funding obtained by an Institutional Partner can
override the Steering Council. If a Partner has
funding to do FEniCS work and the Council decides to not pursue that
work as a project, the Partner is free to pursue it on their
own. However in this situation, that part of the Partner’s work will
not be under the FEniCS umbrella and cannot use the Project trademarks
in a way that suggests a formal relationship.

To acknowledge institutional contributions, there are two level of
Institutional Partners, with associated benefits:

**Tier 1** = an institution with at least one Institutional Council Member

- Acknowledged on FEniCS websites, in talks and T-shirts.
- Ability to acknowledge their own funding sources on FEniCS websites,
  in talks and T-shirts.
- Unlimited participation in the annual Institutional Partners
  Workshop, held during the (planned) annual FEniCS Project
  Retreat. This allows the Institutional Partner to invite as many of
  their own employees and funding sources and collaborators as they
  want, even if they are not project Contributors or Council Members.
- Ability to influence the project through the participation of their
  Council Member.
- Council Members are invited to the bi-annual FEniCS Developer
  Meeting.

**Tier 2** = an institution with at least one Institutional Contributor

- Same benefits as Tier 1 level Partners, but:
- Only Institutional Contributors are invited to the Institutional
  Partners Workshop and bi-annual FEniCS Developer Meeting.


## Changing the Governance Documents

Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a pull request
to The Project's governance documents repository at
<https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/governance>.  The pull request
is then refined in response to public comment and review, with the
goal being consensus in the community.  After this open period, a
Steering Council Member proposes to the Steering Council that the
changes be ratified and the pull request merged (accepting the
proposed changes) or proposes that the pull request be closed without
merging (rejecting the proposed changes).  The Member should state the
final commit hash in the pull request being proposed for acceptance or
rejection and briefly summarize the pull request. A minimum of 80% of
the Steering Council must vote and at least 2/3 of the votes must be
positive to carry out the proposed action (fractions of a vote rounded
up to the nearest integer).
