# Licensing terms

Every component of the FEniCS Project is distributed under a license
approved by the Open Source Initiative
(https://opensource.org/). Currently we use the GNU LGPL version 3.0

## Our copyright policy

FEniCS uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains
copyright over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to
note that these contributions are typically only changes to the
repositories. Thus, the Jupyter source code, in its entirety is not
the copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the
collective copyright of the entire Jupyter Development Team.  If
individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should
indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when
they commit the change to one of the Jupyter repositories.
