# Licensing terms

Every component of the FEniCS Project is distributed under a license
approved by the Open Source Initiative
(https://opensource.org/). Currently we use the GNU LGPL version 3.0 or later
for most components.

Refer to the `LICENSE` or `COPYING` files for each component for
specific information.

## Our copyright policy

FEniCS uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains
copyright over their contributions to FEniCS. But, it is important to
note that these contributions are typically only changes to the
repositories. Thus, the FEniCS source code, in its entirety is not
the copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the
collective copyright of the entire FEniCS Development Team.  If
individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should
indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when
they commit the change to one of the FEniCS repositories.

To protect the FEniCS copyright model, contributors must sign a copyright 
consent form. Ideally, both the contributor and their employer will sign a form. 
Copies of signed consent forms are archived for authors  and 
institutions at http://fenicsproject.org/pub/copyright.
